# 0.3.1

## New Features

- Allow Lacona to control Light/Dark mode ("enable dark mode", "toggle light mode"...)
- Add 3 new themes (light, light-minimal, and dark-minimal)
- The Lacona theme can be set to automatically mirror the OS theme (light/dark mode)
- Switched to "One" color scheme, based on Atom One, for improved light-mode visibility
- Allow vim-style (hjkl) movement when holding the control key
- Added an About panel

## Fixes

- Prevent "rubber band" effect that moves the entire Lacona window when scrolling past edges
- Fix a bug where Lacona could be displayed but not focused
- Prevent Lacona from stealing the current App's focus
- Ensure that "tonight" in "remind me to eat tonight" is properly colorized
- Lacona refuses to launch on OSX <= 10.10

## Changes

- Thin down the status menu icon a bit
- Lacona width is now limited to 820px maximum, to help people with large screens
- Even up the space between fallthroughs and the rest of the words
